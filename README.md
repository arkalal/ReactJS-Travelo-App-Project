# Travel Booking Web App Build - TRAVELO

![BANNER](/public/screenshots/banner.png)

This is the ultimate UI/UX Build of a Travel booking web app called as Travelo...built entirely with ReactJS - JavaScript Library. Before using the web app realtime on your browser, please readout the readme file here to take a tour guide of it.

LET'S BEGIN!! üöÄü§ü

1. Firstly, as you visit the web app, the main home page will popup in your browser and it is a single page app just focused on the UI/UX of it. 

   As you get into the application you will see the banner section beautifully designed with proper opacities and hover effects. 

   The main headline along with a paragraph with a cool date picker functionality has been added on the top of the banner so that it looks very attractive and smooth with a modern UI experience. The banner has been faded a little so that it can have a moderrn attractive look for the user.

   With the date picker the user can pick their respective dates of check in and check out to book their dream holiday destinations for travel. But in this app it is only focused on the UI part. Functionalities are not realtime.

   The explore now button alongside the date picker has a cool hover effect..the navbar has also been built with a slick UI look with attractive hover effects added.

2. Now if you scroll down, you will be able to see the services section. All the services are seperated in four different boxes with proper box shadows added along with a nice transition hover effect. 

   All the icons have been taken from the Material-UI NPM package and the stylings are done with my Pure CSS Skills. I just love pure CSS.

   I have kept the heading and the paragraph very small in each of the service box so that it perfectly fits into it and also looks awesome!!

   The best part of REACT is ..all of the servces sections has been developed once and is spreaded along to four parts with the help of the map loop function of react. First I have created a data object of the services section and then looped through it and made it across four section but styled once.

3. As you scroll down again, now comes the Recommended Destinations section. I have used the same map loop function of react to loop through my recommended destinations data and seperated it into six different boxes but styled and developed only once.

   This is the power of the map loop function of react. So just look at the recommended destination part of the app below üëáüèª

![DESTINATION](/public/screenshots/destinations.png)

   The top active section just below the recommendation headline has been created using the if else logic statements under the map function. Now with this logic, as you click through four different sections on the side that includes 'The Weekend Break' and all the hover color will also shift to that particular section of click.

   Actually I am proficient in pure CSS Flexbox that is the only tool I use while developing all my UI/UX. Flexbox is absolutely great. I also use the main CSS fundamentals as it is very important for building UI structures..but I dont use CSS Grid as it is not needed if I am an expert in Flexbox which is much faster and smoother.

   As I said earlier by looping through the destination boxes I have developed all of the six boxes one after the other by coding only once. 

   I distributed the boxes into two rows by using the CSS Flex Wrap poroperty which also help in responsiveness. It is just great to use it. All of the boxes also have an attractive hover effect with smooth transitions that looks really good.

   Within the boxes I have looped the images, headline, icons and prices all of it that you see in it by destructuring it from the data that I have created for the destination boxes. All of this you can see and understand by going through my files and folders in the repository.

4. Now let's come towards the testimonials part by scrolling down. So this is the testimonial section..first view the screenshot below üëáüèªüìÉ

![TESTIMONIAL](/public/screenshots/testimonials.png)

   This is the testimonials section UI where you will be able to see the reviews of the happy customers after using the services of the app.

   It is absolutely slick and smooth with advanced hover effects along with smooth transitions. Just put your cursor on the top of it to get the experience. But you can see same avatar images in all the of the three boxes. This is because I had only one image in the time of development but others are different.

   So the part is very smooth and absolutely responsive and built with the CSS Flexbox property and flex wrap is also applied to maintain it's overall responsiveness and structure.

5. Now we came down towards the last part of the web app page. This is the footer section which is a must for all the web apps. Have a look below üëáüèª

![FOOTER](/public/screenshots/footer.png)

   The entire app as a overall bluish theme color which is applied as a background in the footer section so that it looks attractive and nice in the eyes of the user. 

   Overall color combination is a very important step that must be in mind while developing web apps as it plays an important role on the entire UI/UX of the website. 

   So within the footer section there are three parts divided with the help of flexbox alignment properties. First part is the copyright section where my name is mentioned üòÅ as the developer, the middle part is the nav links and the right part involves the social icons.


On the extreme right side of the web app you can see an icon with the main logo. It also has a nice hover effect. That is actually the scroll to top button which if clicked, it will take you to the top of the web page.

That is a cool functionality that I have included with the help of pure javascript event listener functionalities so that user can have a nice and slick UI experience...

# Technologies used in Development:

1. ReactJS is the main library on which this project were developed. But along with it many cool HTML5 properties and fucntionalities has been used.

2. The UI has been developed with my pure CSS skills and mainly used my favourite CSS Flexbox Property for building out the base structure UI/UX of the web app.

3. ALso used the media query property of CSS to make the entire web app fully responsive for all of the available devices including mobile, tab etc.

4. I have used the great map looping function of react to develop the multiple boxes all at once by looping through the data that I have created for them. It's just awesome to use that map function and saves a lot of time and provides smart development efficiency.
